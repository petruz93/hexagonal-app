# Hexagonal App

This is a case study for building and learning about Hexagonal Architecture.

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) Architecture in Java, focusing on creating maintainable, testable, and adaptable software systems. By decoupling the core business logic from external technologies such as databases, frameworks, and user interfaces, this approach enables easier testing and future-proofing of the application. The codebase showcases clear separation of concerns, making it straightforward to swap out infrastructure components without impacting the domain logic. This repository is ideal for developers and architects interested in modern software design patterns and best practices for building robust enterprise applications.
