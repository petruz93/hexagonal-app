# Hexagonal App

A case study for building and learning about Hexagonal Architecture.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of the **Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) Architecture** in Java.  
It focuses on creating maintainable, testable, and adaptable software systems by decoupling the core business logic from external technologies such as databases, frameworks, and user interfaces.

---

## Key Features

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  The codebase is organized to keep domain logic independent from infrastructure and frameworks.

- **Testability:**  
  The architecture enables easy unit and integration testing of business logic.

- **Adaptability:**  
  Infrastructure components (like databases or APIs) can be swapped with minimal changes to the core logic.

- **Modern Design Patterns:**  
  Follows best practices for robust enterprise application development.

## Who Is This For?

This repository is ideal for:

- Developers and architects interested in modern software design patterns
- Anyone looking to understand or apply Hexagonal Architecture in Java projects
- Teams aiming for scalable and maintainable codebases
